# Vibe-Coding-Base

This repository demonstrates a compact environment for experimenting with semantic-centric development. It bundles a linter and test suite enforcing the rules found in `AGENTS.md` so that every piece of code carries clear intent. 

The README itself acts as another semantic anchor by summarizing the purpose of the project and helping new contributors understand the context at a glance. The `AGENTS.md` file remains unchanged because it defines the core procedures and must stay stable for consistent development workflows.

This repository currently represents an open-ended template for exploring semantic-centric development. When you repurpose this code for a concrete project, replace this description with details that reflect the new functionality. Keeping the README aligned with the project's real purpose preserves its role as a semantic anchor, while leaving `AGENTS.md` untouched maintains the consistent rules and structure for future development.
